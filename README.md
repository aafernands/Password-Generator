# HOMEWORK WEEK 3 

## Assignment

For this homework project were used JavaScript to generate a random, secure password to the user. The application wouldask a seriof questions to the user in order to generate the password: 
a) length of password (numeric input);
b) validate length is between 8 and 128;
c) type of characters to include - special characters, uppercase, lowercase, numeric(series of yes/no confirms);
d) Validate the user selected at least one character type.

In case of any invalid response the application would terminate and the user would stat over. Once the user has entered valid responses, a password is generated meeting the chosen criteria.

## Features
* Generate button: starts the application and the user answer the prompt questions;
* A text area displays the generated password;
* Copy Button: If user would like to copy the password to clipboard a button is available and once clicked a pop windows display a message with the message copied to clipboard.
